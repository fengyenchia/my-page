                        Hello, I am Yen-Chia Feng. I am currently a student at the Department of Advertising at National Chengchi
                        University, with a double major in the Bachelor's Program in Digital Content and Technology. I
                        specialize in creating visual works with clean lines and vibrant colors, and I also enjoy
                        teamwork and the process of mutual collaboration.<br><br>
                        During my time at university, I have broadened my horizons through internships and club
                        activities. As an assistant at the Digital Platform of NCCU's College of Communication, I also
                        served as a teaching team leader, responsible for organizing design and photography workshops.
                        This experience allowed me to develop skills in event planning and communication. Additionally,
                        I served as the art director for the drama club, where I applied my design skills to create
                        posters. I am currently taking on freelance projects, applying what I have learned to practical
                        work.<br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy drawing and photography to document the details of daily life, which
                        also serves as a source of design inspiration. I firmly believe that continuous learning and
                        hands-on practice are the most effective ways to improve myself. In the future, I hope to
                        continue my passion and enhance my skills to create more interesting and meaningful works.
                    </p>
