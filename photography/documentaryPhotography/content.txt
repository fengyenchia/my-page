壹、家的味道，從一間早餐店開始
One, The Taste of Home Begins at a Breakfast Shop

早餐店，充斥於家家戶戶的住宅區附近，是許多人每天都會走路去用餐的地方。位於桃園區的這家“巴特活力早餐”，是媽媽和外婆一起開的早餐店，外婆原本的工作也是在早餐店當員工，但因為媽媽有個自己開店的夢想，所以她們兩個便一起創業，為了就是幫助女兒完成心願。她們從剛創業的什麼都不懂，純粹是因為興趣與理想，想要完成一個自己開店做餐飲業的夢，靠著一步一腳印，重新開始學習，努力摸索並累積了一群忠實的顧客。
Breakfast shops are ubiquitous in residential areas, a place where many people walk to eat every day. This "Bart's Vitality Breakfast" in Taoyuan District is a breakfast shop opened by my mother and grandmother. My grandmother originally worked as an employee in a breakfast shop, but because my mother had a dream of opening her own shop, the two of them started a business together to help my mother fulfill her wish. They started from scratch, knowing nothing, purely out of interest and ideals, wanting to fulfill a dream of opening their own restaurant. Step by step, they started learning again, worked hard to explore, and accumulated a group of loyal customers.

陸、記住你的口味，是我們的默契
Six, Remembering Your Preference is Our Understanding

顧客上門時她們都以笑臉迎人，有時遇到飲食習慣不變的熟客，甚至不用講要吃什麼，因為她們都已經記得各自習慣的餐點了。這群客人有外帶、有內用，菜單上的選擇更是種類繁多，每個人的喜好也都不一樣，可是她們卻可以在與客人聊天之餘，記住所有人的點餐內容，她們的記憶力每天都在被訓練著。
They greet customers with a smile. Sometimes, when they encounter regular customers whose eating habits do not change, they don't even have to say what they want to eat, because they already remember their usual meals. This group of customers includes those who take out and those who dine in. The choices on the menu are numerous, and everyone's preferences are different. However, they can remember everyone's orders while chatting with customers; their memory is trained every day.

柒、用創意與堅持拉開差距

Although this is a traditional breakfast shop, the menu offers many different flavors for just one type of food, some of which are not even seen in other breakfast shops.

These special flavors have also attracted many customers who want to try something new.

捌、童年的快樂依然存在
Eight, The Joy of Childhood Still Exists

早餐店的調味乳特別訂購有附玩具的，因為老闆們說這是她們童年的回憶，小時候去早餐店最期待的就是挑選自己喜歡的玩具的調味乳，這種既能玩玩具又能喝到好喝的飲料，或許就是小孩子最喜歡的吧！
The breakfast shop specially orders flavored milk that comes with a toy, because the owners say it is a memory of their childhood. When they were young, the thing they looked forward to most at the breakfast shop was choosing their favorite toy- kèm flavored milk. This combination of being able to play with a toy and drink a delicious beverage is perhaps what children love the most!

After 12 o'clock, the crowd gradually thins, but they cannot rest yet.

It is not until three o'clock in the afternoon that a day's work is completed. Only after fully experiencing their routine can one understand the diligence of breakfast shop workers.
