        <h5>One, The Taste of Home Begins at a Breakfast Shop</h5>

        <p>Breakfast shops are ubiquitous in residential areas, a place where many people walk to eat every day. This
            "Bart's Vitality Breakfast" in Taoyuan District is a breakfast shop opened by my mother and grandmother. My
            grandmother originally worked as an employee in a breakfast shop, but because my mother had a dream of
            opening her own shop, the two of them started a business together to help my mother fulfill her wish. They
            started from scratch, knowing nothing, purely out of interest and ideals, wanting to fulfill a dream of
            opening their own restaurant. Step by step, they started learning again, worked hard to explore, and
            accumulated a group of loyal customers.

        <p>They all get up before dawn, leave home at 5 a.m. every morning, and start their day by cleaning and
            preparing
            ingredients as soon as they arrive at the breakfast shop.

            division of labor, customers don't have to wait too long.
        </p>
        <h5>Five, A Gentle Design for Quick Pick-Up</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-5.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-5"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/5.6, Shutter speed: 1/60s, ISO: 1000</small></figcaption>
        <p>Early in the morning, they will display a wide variety of sandwiches, making it convenient for customers in a
            hurry to grab their meals quickly.
        </p>
        <h5>Six, Remembering Your Preference is Our Understanding</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-6.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-6"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/5.6, Shutter speed: 1/50s, ISO: 800</small></figcaption>
        <p>They greet customers with a smile. Sometimes, when they encounter regular customers whose eating habits do
            not change, they don't even have to say what they want to eat, because they already remember their usual
            meals. This group of customers includes those who take out and those who dine in. The choices on the menu
            are numerous, and everyone's preferences are different. However, they can remember everyone's orders while
            chatting with customers; their memory is trained every day.
        </p>
        <h5>Seven, Creating a Difference with Creativity and Persistence</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-7.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-7"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/5.6, Shutter speed: 1/80s, ISO: 800</small></figcaption>
        <p>Although this is a traditional breakfast shop, the menu offers many different flavors for just one type of
            food, some of which are not even seen in other breakfast shops. These are the results of their constant
            experimentation and selection of satisfactory suppliers, in order to meet the different preferences of
            different age groups. These special flavors have also attracted many customers who want to try something
            new.
        </p>
        <h5>Eight, The Joy of Childhood Still Exists</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-8.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-8"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/5.6, Shutter speed: 1/100s, ISO: 800</small></figcaption>
        <p>The breakfast shop specially orders flavored milk that comes with a toy, because the owners say it is a
            memory of their childhood. When they were young, the thing they looked forward to most at the breakfast shop
            was choosing their favorite toy- kèm flavored milk. This combination of being able to play with a toy and
            drink a delicious beverage is perhaps what children love the most!
        </p>
        <h5>Nine, The Work Isn't Over After Noon</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-9.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-9"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/4.5, Shutter speed: 1/60s, ISO: 800</small></figcaption>
        <p>After 12 o'clock, the crowd gradually thins, but they cannot rest yet. They begin to clean up the
            environment, busy with sweeping, tidying up the garbage, calculating the day's turnover, preparing
            ingredients for the next day, buying used-up ingredients, and restocking... They do these things without
            being careless at all, doing their best. After all these things are done, it is unknowingly already three
            o'clock in the afternoon.
        </p>
        <h5>Ten, Every Day is for That Warm Meal and Smile</h5>
        <img src="/my-page/photography/documentaryPhotography/日復一日，破曉與夕陽-10.jpg" alt="Documentary Photography-10"
            class="mw-100 rounded">
        <figcaption><small>Aperture: f/3.5, Shutter speed: 1/125s, ISO: 125</small></figcaption>
        <p>They work 10 hours a day and only take one day off a month, all to ensure that every student, every office
            worker, and every resident can have a delicious breakfast every morning. It is not until three o'clock in
            the afternoon that a day's work is completed. Only after fully experiencing their routine can one understand
            the diligence of breakfast shop workers. They work from dawn until the afternoon, yet they do not mind the
            exhaustion. They are people who work hard for their passion for cooking and for life.
